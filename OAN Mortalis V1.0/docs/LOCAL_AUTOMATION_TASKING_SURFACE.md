# LOCAL_AUTOMATION_TASKING_SURFACE

## Purpose

This document defines the formal tasking surface for the local governed automation cycle.

It exists so the automation is not merely "running somewhere."

It must always be possible to say:

- which tasks exist
- which authority owns them
- what completes them
- what makes them escalate
- where their live status is written

## Governing Contract

The machine-readable contract lives in:

- `build/local-automation-tasking.json`

The live applied status surfaces are:

- `.audit/state/local-automation-tasking-status.json`
- `.audit/state/local-automation-tasking-status.md`

Those live surfaces apply the current automation state onto the formal task definitions below.

## Long-Form Task Maps

The tasking surface also carries bounded long-form maps.

Current active map:

- `Automation Maturation Map 01`

Next eligible map:

- `Automation Maturation Map 02`

Time-dilation rule:

- if the active map completes earlier than expected, the agentic working group may pull work only from the next declared map
- no pull-forward may skip beyond that next map
- blocked or HITL-required posture prevents pull-forward

This keeps acceleration lawful without turning early completion into uncontrolled scope widening.

## Formal Tasks

### Release Candidate Cycle

- Owner: `Automation`
- Authority: `Mechanical only`
- Cadence: every `6` hours
- Purpose: run the governed release-candidate conveyor and emit the latest candidate evidence bundle
- Completion signal: a valid `build-evidence-manifest.json` exists in the newest release-candidate bundle
- Escalates when:
  - the local cycle becomes `blocked`
  - the release-candidate run cannot emit a valid bundle

### Daily HITL Digest

- Owner: `Automation`
- Authority: `Mechanical only`
- Cadence: every `24` hours
- Purpose: generate the single bounded daily review surface for HITL
- Completion signal: the latest digest bundle contains both JSON and Markdown review artifacts
- Escalates when:
  - the digest posture requires immediate HITL
  - the digest bundle cannot be produced

### Promotion Watch

- Owner: `Shared`
- Authority: `Automation may classify; HITL decides promotion`
- Trigger: latest digest posture
- Purpose: determine whether automation may continue stretching, whether HITL is required, or whether the system is blocked
- Completion signal: the current posture is reflected in the task-status surface
- Escalates when:
  - the recommended action becomes review-required-before-promotion
  - the posture becomes `blocked`

### Scheduler Watch

- Owner: `Automation`
- Authority: `Machine-local only`
- Trigger: Windows scheduled task registration and next-run clock
- Purpose: ensure the local automation cycle is actually scheduled and not merely manually provable
- Completion signal: the scheduled task is registered and exposes a next run time
- Escalates when:
  - the scheduled task is not registered
  - the scheduled task has no next run time

## First Long-Form Task Set

### Automation Maturation Map 01

- Goal: make the current local automation cycle report transitions, first scheduled execution truth, and status freshness without requiring manual probing
- Expected review windows: `2`
- Selected tasks:
  - `Notification Surface`
  - `First Scheduled Run Capture`
  - `Status Freshness Reconciliation`

### Automation Maturation Map 02

- Goal: deepen unattended evidence quality without crossing into ungated promotion authority
- Expected review windows: `2`
- Queued tasks:
  - `Delta Summary Surface`
  - `Artifact Retention Pruning`
  - `Blocked Escalation Bundle`

## Status Interpretation

The task board must distinguish between:

- `waiting-for-cadence`
- `waiting-for-daily-review`
- `clear-to-continue`
- `hitl-required`
- `blocked`
- `scheduler-unregistered`
- `scheduler-ready`

These are operational postures, not release claims.

## Authority Boundary

This tasking surface does not give automation new authority.

It makes current authority legible.

Automation may continue mechanical work inside its declared cadence.

HITL remains mandatory for:

- modular-set promotion
- new deployable introduction
- authority widening
- publication promotion
- unresolved blocked states
